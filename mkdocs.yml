Learn about the threat detection capabilities of Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie and AWS Security Hub and the available response options. For each hands-on scenario, we review methods to detect and respond to threats using the following services: AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC flow logs, Amazon CloudWatch Events, Amazon Macie, AWS Lambda, Amazon Inspector, Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon Security Hub.'
